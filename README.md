# Mathematica-notebook-for-MC-and-MLMC-covariance-estimation

This repository contains a Mathematica notebook which lists and generates equations related to h-statistics based Monte Carlo (MC) and Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) covariance estimation using the [mathStatica](http://www.mathstatica.com/) library.

The notebook provided here serves as supplementary material for the article titled "S. Shivanand. Covariance estimation using h-statistics in Monte Carlo and multilevel Monte Carlo
methods. arXiv, 2023.", which can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2311.01336).
